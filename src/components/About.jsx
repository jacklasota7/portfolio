            </h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed font-mono">
              As I finish my degree in Computational Biology, I've been drawn to the challenge of building and understanding computational tools. Along the way, I've strengthened my programming skills in Python and JAVA through coursework and my HuBMAP internship. To push myself further, I began learning React and built this website from scratch, discovering how much I enjoy the creative side of programming. Looking ahead, I'm excited to dive deeper into machine learning, artificial intelligence, and their everyday applications.

              I'm a first-generation Polish-American, and my heritage plays a big role in who I am. That's why, in addition to my Computational Biology major, I minored in Polish Studies and even had the chance to study abroad in Krak√≥w, Poland. Outside of academics, I'm happiest outdoors snowboarding, hiking, or playing sports. Baseball was my first love, and as someone from the D.C. area, I'll always be a die-hard Nationals fan (2019 Champs!). When I'm not outside, I'm usually relaxing with a good video game. Right now, I'm hooked on Spider-Man 2 for PS5.
